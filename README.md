Games
=====

Games developed by me after being influenced by Python programming course on Coursera.
This is the primary repository I'll be using to manage the code for the games I have developed in past or will develop in the future.
Please read the wiki for more details.

Notes (19 Apr 2025):
====================
To run OldCode in Mac:
- Create a venv: `python3 -m venv game_venv`
- Install pygame: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame`
- Activate pygame: `source game_venv/bin/activate`
- Start old code game: `python python3_hangman.py` (from non-full-screen terminal window)
